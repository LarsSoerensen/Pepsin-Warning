# Pepsin-Warning
This software will identfy if an PLGS identified sequence is in violation of the pepsin cleavage rule as determined in:
Y. Hamuro et al. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2008; 22: 1041â€“1046
In this script it's only the peptides with H,K,R,P in position P1' or P in P2' that are removed
The seqeunce of the protein is required and can be loaded using a FASTA sequence and the load fasta button.
The .CSV output from LARS can be used to provide the list of identified peptides or any file adhering to the Waters Ion accounting .csv format
